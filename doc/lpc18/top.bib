                  recent technology available in the Linux kernel that
                  enables flexible data processing. However, so far
                  the eBPF was mainly used for monitoring tasks such
                  as memory, CPU, page faults, traffic, and more, with
                  a few examples of traditional network services,
                  e.g., that modify the data in transit. In fact, the
                  creation of complex network functions that go beyond
                  simple proof-of- concept data plane applications has
                  proven to be challenging due to the several
                  limitations of this technology, but at the same time
                  very promising due to some characteristics (e.g.,
                  dynamic recompilation of the source code) that are
                  not available elsewhere.  Based on our experience,
                  this paper presents the most promising
                  characteristics of this technology and the main
                  encountered limitations, and we envision some
                  solutions that can mitigate the latter. We also
                  summarize the most important lessons learned while
                  exploiting eBPF to create complex network functions
                  and, finally, we provide a quantitative
                  characterization of the most significant aspects of
                  this technology.}
